Kwago’s mission is to nurture empathy, creativity and innovation through reading. We continuously work with equally passionate individuals and organizations to create programs that encourage deep love for literature and constant learning.



Part library, part bookstore, part cafe bar, the Book Bar at Warehouse Eight is designed to help you discover new ideas, understand the pulse of the local literary and arts landscape, and cultivate an interdisciplinary mindset.



Kwago’s growing inventory is a personal inquiry about who we are and who we could become in the grand scheme of things. It reflects our genuine love for culture, science and technology, and our commitment to support the thriving independent press and artist publisher communities in the Philippines.
