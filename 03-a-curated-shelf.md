Committed to nurturing a deeper understanding of the many ways we read, write and publish, Kwago collaborated with Comma to develop a special program: A Curated Shelf. With an aim to address a wide range of questions on the relevance and scope of publishing, A Curated Shelf is a space for critical and playful conversations about publications and publishing as a discursive practice.

The program is composed of a series of two-month exhibitions, corollary events that respond to these shows and catalogues that extend the discourse in print.

The dream is to bring the program in spaces outside the book bar and open up dialogues on reading, writing and publishing to a broader audience. Please contact us if youâ€™re interested to adopt the program in your space: <a href="mailto:inbetweencommas@gmail.com">inbetweencommas@gmail.com.</a>
