thanks for dropping by my third home.
<br />
by entering, you make this a sanctuary.
<br />
my words in this in-between create silence,
<br />
a poem to substitute the intimacy
<br />
my skin yearns to share with another but can’t.
<br />
you don’t see me. I don’t see you. but we are here.
<br />
you are holding me. I am holding you.
<br />
I am really glad you came.
