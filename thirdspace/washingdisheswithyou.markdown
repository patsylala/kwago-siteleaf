As a mom, I see domestic activities as architecture. the hands who cook and wash your clothes build you. care work is what makes a home. touch is what molds a person.

I invite you to be my co-carpenter and construct a home within a home within a home within a home within a home without a home within a hole within a home without a hole within a home within a home within an outpost within a home within a hole within a home within a home without a hole within a home—a portal, a possibility, a pandemic.

you send me a photo of you washing the dishes,
and I send you one of mine. I put our photos in a 1080 x 1080 digital frame, side by side like a diptych, and I turn it into a page in a book that I will give to you as a gift 6 months from now—a gesture of gratitude for your involvement.

You could invite 10 friends who you want to build a home with—someone you miss, someone you want to reconnect with, someone important to you—to send you photos of them washing dishes. You can send me their photos, and I will create a diptych out of your photos. The content of the book are the photos I receive on my daughter’s birthday- August 18.
