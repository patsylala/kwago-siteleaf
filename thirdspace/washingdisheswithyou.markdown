Hello. 

Thank you for dropping by my third home. 
By entering, you make this a sanctuary.
My words in this in-between create silence,
A poem to substitute the intimacy
my skin yearns to share with another but can’t. 
You don’t see me. I don’t see you. But we are here.
You are holding me. I am holding you.
I am really glad you came.
