Thank you for dropping by my third home.
<br /><br />
By entering, you make this a sanctuary.
<br /><br />
My words in this in-between create silence,
<br /><br />
A poem to substitute the intimacy
<br /><br />
my skin yearns to share with another but can’t.
<br /><br />
You don’t see me. I don’t see you. But we are here.
<br /><br />
You are holding me. I am holding you.
<br /><br />
I am really glad you came.
