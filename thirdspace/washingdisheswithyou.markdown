send me a photo of you washing the dishes,
and I send you one of mine. I put your photo in a book that I will give to you as a gift 6 months from now—a gesture of gratitude for your involvement. 

you could invite 10 friends who you want to build a home with—someone you miss during this period of crisis, someone you want to reconnect with, someone important to you—to send you photos of them washing dishes. You can send me their photos, and I will include them in the book. The content of the book are the photos I receive on my daughter’s birthday - August 18.

All photos go to: washingdisheswithyou@gmail.com

Project archive will be exhibited on IG: @washingdisheswithyou
