thanks for dropping by my third home.
by entering, you make this a sanctuary.
my words in this in-between create silence,
a poem to substitute the intimacy
my skin yearns to share with another but can’t.
you don’t see me. I don’t see you. but we are here.
you are holding me. I am holding you.
I am really glad you came.

As a mom, I see domestic activities as
architecture. The hands who cook and wash your clothes
build you. Care work is what makes a home.
Touch is what molds a person.

I invite you to be my co-carpenter and construct
a home within a home within a home within
A home within a home without a home within a
Hole within a home without a hole within a home
Within a home within a outpost within a home within a hole
a home within a home without a hole within a home—
A portal, a possibility, a pandemic.

You send me a photo of
You washing the dishes,
and I send you one of mine.
I put our photos in a 1080 x 1080 digital frame,
Side by side as a diptych on a plain
white background, and I turn it into a page in a book
that I will give to you as a gift 6 months from now—
a gesture of gratitude for your involvement.

You could invite 10 friends who you want to build a home with,
Someone you miss, someone you want to build intimacy with.
You can send me their photos, and I will create a diptych.
The content of the book are the photos I receive on my daughter’s birthday- August 18.
My home.

All photos go to: washingdisheswithyou@gmail.com
Pages of the book will be exhibited on IG: @washingdisheswithyou

You can also publish your own version of the book. You can do the project on your own and modify it as you please.
