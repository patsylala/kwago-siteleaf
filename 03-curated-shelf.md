Committed to nurturing a deeper understanding of the many ways we read, write and publish, Kwago collaborated with Comma to develop a special program: A Curated Shelf. With an aim to address a wide range of questions on the relevance and scope of publishing, A Curated Shelf is a space for critical and playful conversations about publications and publishing as a discursive practice.

Composed of a series of two-month exhibitions with corollary events that respond to the shows, the program will be introduced to spaces outside the book bar in the upcoming months to be able to the bring the dialogues on reading, writing and publishing to a broader audience.
